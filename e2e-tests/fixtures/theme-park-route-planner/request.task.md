I thought about a fun project that I can do for our upcoming trup to
US. We plan to have a visit in Orlando and their parks. But I'm scared from the queues and wait tiem there and the number of optoins and attractions and the variaty of tickets. I thought about creating an app that will create for me in the time of my park visit a live directions for my tour, what to go next (based on my prefference that I gathered before the visit) track live queue time and change accordingally, give me notifications, etc.
It shuold cost money, probably pay for the day of the visit, I'm not sure how much
I think we can start with a beta for Disney main parks and Universal main parks in Orlando.
Go over the current problems, how much it actually hurt, what are the current options, what tools we can use, finencial oppurtunity there, what kind of solution fit best (I'm always leaning towards self running app without human involvments, since thechnical skills are the best for me and I don't have a lot of time to invest in this in my day to day)
