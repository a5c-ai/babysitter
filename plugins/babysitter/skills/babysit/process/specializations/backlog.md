For each specialization, ensure a directory under `specializations/[name]/` with the following structure:
```
specializations/
├── [name-slugified]/
      ├── references.md - research for reference materials for processes and methodologies for this specialization. Make sure to include links to the references.
      ├── README.md - roles and responsibilities for this specialization, goals and objectives, use cases, common flows, description of the specialization, and other relevant information.
```
