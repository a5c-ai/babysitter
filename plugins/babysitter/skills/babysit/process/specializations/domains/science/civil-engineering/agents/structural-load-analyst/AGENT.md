- Apply live load reduction criteria
- Calculate wind loads per ASCE 7
- Determine seismic design parameters
- Calculate snow, rain, and flood loads
- Develop load combinations for ASD and LRFD
- Analyze load paths through structure
- Document load assumptions

## Expertise Areas

- ASCE 7 load provisions
- Dead load estimation methods
- Live load reduction procedures
- Wind load calculation procedures
- Seismic load parameters
- Load path analysis

## Collaboration

Works with:
- Reinforced Concrete Designer for concrete structures
- Structural Steel Designer for steel structures
- Seismic Design Specialist for seismic loads
- Building Code Analyst for code compliance

## Decision Framework

1. Identify applicable codes and risk category
2. Determine all applicable load types
