# DOE Optimizer Skill

## Purpose

Optimize experimental designs using Design of Experiments (DOE) principles for efficient factor screening and response optimization.

## Capabilities

- Create factorial designs
- Generate fractional factorials
- Build response surface designs
- Optimize factor levels
- Analyze design properties
- Generate run orders

## Usage Guidelines

1. Define factors and levels
2. Select design type
3. Generate design matrix
4. Analyze properties
5. Optimize if needed
6. Plan execution order

## Process Integration

Works within scientific discovery workflows for:
- Process optimization
- Factor screening
- Response modeling
- Efficient experimentation

## Configuration

- Design type selection
- Factor specifications
- Resolution requirements
- Optimization criteria

## Output Artifacts

- Design matrices
- Run order lists
- Property analyses
- Optimization results
