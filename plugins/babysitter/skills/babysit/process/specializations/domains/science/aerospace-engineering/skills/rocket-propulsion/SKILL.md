# Rocket Propulsion Analysis Skill

## Purpose
Enable comprehensive rocket engine design and performance analysis including combustion analysis, nozzle design, and propellant optimization.

## Capabilities
- CEA combustion analysis integration
- Nozzle design and optimization (bell, aerospike)
- Propellant selection and performance comparison
- Chamber pressure and mixture ratio optimization
- Regenerative cooling analysis
- Injector design considerations
- Thrust vectoring system analysis
- Rocket Propulsion Analysis (RPA) integration

## Usage Guidelines
- Use CEA for accurate combustion product calculations
- Optimize mixture ratio for specific impulse or thrust requirements
- Consider thermal management in chamber and nozzle design
- Account for real gas effects at high pressures
- Validate designs against empirical correlations and test data
- Document propellant properties and compatibility considerations

## Dependencies
- CEA (Chemical Equilibrium with Applications)
- RPA (Rocket Propulsion Analysis)
- MATLAB

## Process Integration
- AE-005: Rocket Propulsion Design
