   - Identify patterns in data
   - Recognize structural similarities
   - Extract invariants

2. **Conjecture Refinement**
   - Sharpen vague conjectures
   - Add necessary conditions
   - Remove redundancies

3. **Counterexample Guidance**
   - Guide counterexample search
   - Analyze failed cases
   - Refine based on near-misses

4. **Known Results Relationship**
   - Connect to existing theorems
   - Identify special cases
   - Find generalizations

5. **Generalization and Specialization**
   - Suggest generalizations
   - Identify interesting special cases
   - Find boundary conditions

6. **Difficulty Assessment**
   - Estimate proof difficulty
   - Identify required techniques
   - Suggest approach strategies
