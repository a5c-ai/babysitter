# Avionics System Integration Skill

## Purpose
Enable avionics architecture design and system integration including bus protocols, redundancy management, and human-machine interface design.

## Capabilities
- Avionics architecture definition
- ARINC 429/664 bus specification
- Federated vs IMA architecture
- Redundancy management design
- Data loading requirements
- Built-in test (BIT) requirements
- Human-machine interface specification
- Crew alerting system design

## Usage Guidelines
- Define avionics architecture based on safety and performance requirements
- Select appropriate bus protocols for data rate and criticality
- Design redundancy to meet system safety requirements
- Implement comprehensive built-in test capabilities
- Design crew interfaces following human factors principles
- Coordinate with certification for novel avionics features

## Dependencies
- Avionics specification tools
- Bus analysis tools
- Human factors guidelines

## Process Integration
- Systems integration processes
- Avionics certification planning
