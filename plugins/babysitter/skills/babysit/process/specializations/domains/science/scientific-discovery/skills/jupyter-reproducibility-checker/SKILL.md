# Jupyter Reproducibility Checker Skill

## Purpose

Check and ensure reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks including cell execution order, environment dependencies, and output consistency.

## Capabilities

- Verify execution order
- Check dependencies
- Test reproducibility
- Clear and rerun notebooks
- Document environments
- Generate requirements

## Usage Guidelines

1. Load notebook
2. Check execution order
3. Identify dependencies
4. Test fresh execution
5. Document environment
6. Generate reports

## Process Integration

Works within scientific discovery workflows for:
- Reproducibility audits
- Notebook cleanup
- Environment documentation
- Quality assurance

## Configuration

- Check criteria
- Execution settings
- Environment capture
- Report formatting

## Output Artifacts

- Reproducibility reports
- Dependency lists
- Environment files
- Cleaned notebooks
