## Overview

Mathematics is the foundational discipline that underpins all quantitative sciences, engineering, finance, and increasingly, modern technology including artificial intelligence and data science. This specialization encompasses the full breadth of mathematical inquiry, from abstract pure mathematics concerned with fundamental structures and proofs, to applied mathematics that develops mathematical methods for practical problem-solving, to statistics that provides the theoretical framework for data analysis and inference.

The field spans multiple interconnected areas: algebra and number theory exploring abstract structures; analysis and calculus studying continuous change and limits; geometry and topology examining spatial properties and invariants; probability and statistics providing tools for uncertainty quantification; numerical methods enabling computational solutions to mathematical problems; and mathematical modeling translating real-world phenomena into mathematical frameworks.

Modern mathematics increasingly leverages computational tools for exploration, proof assistance, symbolic computation, and numerical simulation. The intersection of mathematics with computer science has given rise to computational mathematics, which develops algorithms for mathematical problems and applies mathematical rigor to computational questions.
