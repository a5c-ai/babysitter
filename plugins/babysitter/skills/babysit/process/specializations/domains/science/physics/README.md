## Overview

Physics is the fundamental natural science that studies matter, energy, motion, and force, seeking to understand how the universe behaves at every scale from subatomic particles to cosmic structures. This specialization encompasses the complete spectrum of physical inquiry, from theoretical frameworks and mathematical formulations to experimental methodologies and computational simulations.

The discipline is organized around several major branches: classical mechanics describes the motion of macroscopic objects; electromagnetism governs electric and magnetic phenomena and light; thermodynamics addresses heat, energy, and entropy; quantum mechanics reveals the behavior of matter at atomic and subatomic scales; and particle physics probes the fundamental constituents of matter and their interactions.

Modern physics increasingly relies on computational methods to solve complex problems that defy analytical solutions. From molecular dynamics simulations to finite element analysis, from Monte Carlo methods to numerical solutions of differential equations, computational physics bridges theory and experiment while enabling discoveries in areas ranging from condensed matter to cosmology.

This specialization is essential for researchers pushing the frontiers of knowledge, engineers applying physical principles to technology development, educators training the next generation of scientists, and professionals in industries spanning energy, materials, aerospace, electronics, and medical physics.
