# Scientific Discovery and Problem Solving - Processes Backlog (Phase 2)

## Overview

This backlog contains key processes for the Scientific Discovery and Problem Solving specialization, organized by category. These processes cover the systematic approaches, thinking patterns, and methodologies used to investigate phenomena, solve complex problems, and generate new knowledge.
