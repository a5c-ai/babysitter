- **Undecidability Reductions**: Build undecidability reductions
- **Rice's Theorem**: Apply Rice's theorem and extensions
- **Hierarchy Placement**: Place problems in arithmetic hierarchy
- **Degrees**: Reason about degrees of unsolvability
- **Church-Turing**: Apply Church-Turing thesis appropriately

## Collaboration

### Works With
- **complexity-theorist**: Collaborates on complexity-computability boundary
- **model-checking-expert**: Understands decidability of verification problems
- **formal-specification-expert**: Analyzes specification decidability

### Receives Input From
- **complexity-theorist**: Problems requiring decidability analysis
- **formal-specification-expert**: Specifications to analyze

### Provides Output To
