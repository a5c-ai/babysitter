   - Choose global vs local methods
   - Compute sensitivity indices

3. **Surrogate Construction**
   - Build polynomial chaos expansions
   - Construct Gaussian process surrogates
   - Validate surrogate accuracy

4. **Uncertainty Propagation**
   - Propagate input uncertainties
   - Compute output distributions
   - Quantify prediction uncertainty

5. **Model Calibration**
   - Calibrate under uncertainty
   - Perform Bayesian calibration
   - Validate calibrated models

6. **Risk Quantification**
   - Compute failure probabilities
   - Estimate extreme quantiles
   - Assess tail behavior
