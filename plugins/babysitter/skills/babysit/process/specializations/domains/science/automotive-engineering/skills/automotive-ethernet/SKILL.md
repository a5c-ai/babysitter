# Automotive Ethernet Skill

## Purpose
Enable automotive Ethernet implementation and validation for high-bandwidth vehicle communication including SOME/IP services and time-sensitive networking.

## Capabilities
- 100BASE-T1/1000BASE-T1 configuration
- SOME/IP service design and implementation
- DoIP (Diagnostics over IP) configuration
- AVB/TSN time-sensitive networking
- Ethernet switch configuration
- VLAN and QoS setup
- PDU routing and gateway design
- Network intrusion detection

## Usage Guidelines
- Design network topology for bandwidth and latency requirements
- Implement SOME/IP services following AUTOSAR specifications
- Configure TSN for time-critical applications
- Set up VLANs for network segmentation
- Implement security measures for network protection
- Validate network performance under load

## Dependencies
- Vector CANoe
- Wireshark
- Automotive Ethernet test tools

## Process Integration
- ASD-001: AUTOSAR Architecture Implementation
- ASD-004: Over-the-Air (OTA) Update Implementation
- SAF-004: Cybersecurity Engineering (ISO/SAE 21434)
