# Business Analysis and Consulting

## Specialization Overview

Business Analysis and Consulting is a comprehensive discipline focused on understanding organizational needs, identifying opportunities for improvement, and designing solutions that deliver measurable business value. This specialization encompasses requirements gathering, process analysis, stakeholder management, solution design, consulting methodologies, and change management.

Business analysts and consultants serve as the critical bridge between business stakeholders and solution delivery teams.
