## Key Frameworks

### Knowledge Creation and Conversion

#### SECI Model (Nonaka and Takeuchi)
The foundational framework for understanding knowledge creation and conversion:

- **Socialization (Tacit to Tacit)**: Sharing tacit knowledge through shared experiences, observation, imitation, and practice. Knowledge is transferred between individuals without explicit articulation.

- **Externalization (Tacit to Explicit)**: Converting tacit knowledge into explicit concepts through dialogue, reflection, metaphors, analogies, and documentation. This is key to creating organizational knowledge.

- **Combination (Explicit to Explicit)**: Combining different bodies of explicit knowledge through documents, meetings, databases, and networks. Systematizing and categorizing explicit knowledge.

- **Internalization (Explicit to Tacit)**: Embodying explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge through learning by doing, simulation, and practice. Knowledge becomes personal expertise.

The knowledge spiral represents continuous iteration through these four modes, creating new organizational knowledge.

#### Ba (Knowledge Space)
Nonaka's concept of shared context for knowledge creation:

- **Originating Ba**: Face-to-face interactions for sharing emotions and experiences (Socialization)
- **Dialoguing Ba**: Peer-to-peer dialogue for articulating tacit knowledge (Externalization)
- **Systemizing Ba**: Virtual collaboration for combining explicit knowledge (Combination)
- **Exercising Ba**: Individual embodiment of explicit knowledge (Internalization)

### Knowledge Classification and Complexity

#### Cynefin Framework (Dave Snowden)
A sense-making framework for understanding context and appropriate responses:

- **Clear (Simple)**: Cause and effect are obvious. Best practice approaches work. Sense-Categorize-Respond.

- **Complicated**: Cause and effect require analysis or expertise. Good practice approaches work. Sense-Analyze-Respond.

- **Complex**: Cause and effect are only coherent in retrospect. Emergent practice required. Probe-Sense-Respond.

- **Chaotic**: No clear cause and effect relationships. Novel practice required. Act-Sense-Respond.

- **Disorder (Confused)**: Not knowing which domain applies. The goal is to move to an appropriate domain.

The framework helps determine whether to apply best practices, expertise, experimentation, or immediate action.

#### Knowledge Types
Classification of organizational knowledge:

- **Tacit Knowledge**: Personal, context-specific, hard to formalize and communicate
- **Explicit Knowledge**: Codified, systematic, easily transmitted through documents
- **Implicit Knowledge**: Can be articulated but has not been documented
- **Embedded Knowledge**: Built into processes, products, culture, and routines

### Organizational Learning

#### Single and Double-Loop Learning (Argyris and Schon)
Levels of organizational learning:

- **Single-Loop Learning**: Detecting and correcting errors within existing assumptions and norms. Adjusting actions to achieve goals.

- **Double-Loop Learning**: Questioning and modifying underlying assumptions, policies, and objectives. Learning that changes the learning system itself.

- **Triple-Loop Learning**: Learning about the learning process itself. Developing capacity to learn.

#### Learning Organization Disciplines (Peter Senge)
Five disciplines for building a learning organization:

1. **Personal Mastery**: Individual commitment to learning and growth
2. **Mental Models**: Examining assumptions and generalizations
3. **Shared Vision**: Building common pictures of the future
4. **Team Learning**: Group dialogue and thinking together
5. **Systems Thinking**: Understanding interconnections and patterns

### Knowledge Management Strategy

#### Knowledge Management Maturity Model
Stages of organizational KM capability:

1. **Initial**: Ad hoc, individual-dependent knowledge practices
2. **Repeatable**: Basic KM processes established, some documentation
3. **Defined**: Standardized KM processes across the organization
4. **Managed**: Quantitative management of KM processes and outcomes
5. **Optimizing**: Continuous improvement of KM based on metrics and feedback

#### Knowledge Strategy Approaches
- **Codification Strategy**: Focus on capturing and storing knowledge in databases for reuse
- **Personalization Strategy**: Focus on connecting people for knowledge sharing through networks
- **Hybrid Strategy**: Balanced approach combining both codification and personalization

### Communities of Practice

#### Community of Practice Model (Wenger, McDermott, Snyder)
Three fundamental elements:

- **Domain**: Area of knowledge that creates common ground and identity
- **Community**: Group of people who interact, learn together, and build relationships
- **Practice**: Shared repertoire of resources, experiences, tools, and approaches

#### Community Lifecycle Stages
1. **Potential**: People face similar situations without shared practice
2. **Coalescing**: Members come together and recognize potential
3. **Maturing**: Community engages in learning projects, develops practices
4. **Stewardship**: Sustaining momentum and maintaining relevance
5. **Transformation**: Evolution, merger, or dissolution
