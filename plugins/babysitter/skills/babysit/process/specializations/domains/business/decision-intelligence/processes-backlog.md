# Processes Backlog - Intelligence, Decision Support and Decision Making

This backlog defines the key processes for the Intelligence, Decision Support and Decision Making specialization. These processes cover business intelligence reporting, competitive intelligence, market intelligence, decision frameworks, scenario planning, and analytics-driven decision making. Each process is designed to be implemented as an automated workflow that guides practitioners through structured methodologies while maintaining flexibility for organizational context and requirements.
