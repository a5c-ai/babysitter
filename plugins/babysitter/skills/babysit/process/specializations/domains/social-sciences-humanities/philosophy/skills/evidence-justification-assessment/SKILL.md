# Evidence and Justification Assessment Skill

Evaluate epistemic warrant and evidence quality using appropriate standards across different domains of inquiry.

## Overview

The Evidence and Justification Assessment skill enables evaluation of epistemic warrant, assessment of evidence quality and relevance, application of epistemic standards appropriate to different domains, identification of knowledge sources, and analysis of justificatory structures.

## Capabilities

### Evidence Evaluation
- Assess evidence quality
- Evaluate relevance to claims
- Consider evidence weight
- Identify evidence types
- Check evidence reliability

### Justification Analysis
- Identify justificatory structures
- Evaluate warrant transmission
- Assess foundational vs. coherentist structures
- Analyze inferential chains
- Check for circular reasoning

### Epistemic Standards Application
- Apply domain-appropriate standards
- Distinguish epistemic contexts
- Evaluate certainty requirements
- Consider practical stakes
- Balance rigor and feasibility

### Source Assessment
- Identify knowledge sources
- Evaluate source reliability
- Consider testimony
- Assess expertise claims
- Check for bias and conflict

### Skeptical Analysis
- Address skeptical challenges
- Evaluate defeaters
- Consider alternative explanations
- Assess epistemic closure
- Navigate skeptical arguments

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use
- Evaluating knowledge claims
- Assessing arguments
- Analyzing evidence
