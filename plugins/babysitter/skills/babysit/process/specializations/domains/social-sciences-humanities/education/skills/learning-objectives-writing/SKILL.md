# Learning Objectives Writing

Write measurable, SMART learning objectives using Bloom's Taxonomy cognitive levels aligned with desired outcomes and assessment strategies.

## Overview

This skill enables the creation of clear, measurable learning objectives that guide instructional design and assessment. It encompasses application of Bloom's Taxonomy, SMART criteria, and alignment with assessment strategies to ensure effective learning outcome specification.

## Capabilities

### Bloom's Taxonomy Application
- Apply cognitive domain levels appropriately
- Use action verbs matched to cognitive levels
- Sequence objectives by complexity
- Address affective and psychomotor domains
- Align objectives with assessment methods

### SMART Criteria
- Write Specific objectives
- Ensure Measurability
- Verify Achievability
- Confirm Relevance
- Define Time-bound expectations

### Alignment Strategies
- Link objectives to organizational goals
- Connect to assessment methods
- Sequence within curriculum
- Map to competency frameworks
- Ensure instructional alignment

### Documentation
- Format objectives consistently
- Organize by module or unit
- Include conditions and criteria
- Document alignment rationale
- Create objective hierarchies

## Usage Guidelines

### Writing Process
1. Identify desired performance outcomes
2. Determine appropriate cognitive level
3. Select measurable action verbs
4. Specify conditions and criteria
5. Verify SMART criteria
6. Validate alignment

### Action Verb Selection
- Remember: list, define, recall, identify
- Understand: explain, summarize, interpret
- Apply: demonstrate, implement, use
- Analyze: compare, differentiate, examine
- Evaluate: critique, assess, judge
- Create: design, develop, construct

### Quality Criteria
- One behavior per objective
- Observable and measurable
- Learner-centered focus
- Appropriate level of challenge
- Clear conditions and standards
