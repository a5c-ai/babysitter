# Quantitative Methods Skill

Design and execute rigorous statistical analyses for social science research using modern analytical tools.

## Overview

The Quantitative Methods skill enables design and execution of statistical analyses including regression modeling, hypothesis testing, power analysis, and robustness checks using R, Stata, SPSS, or Python for rigorous quantitative social science research.

## Capabilities

### Regression Analysis

- Sensitivity analysis

### Robustness Checking
- Specification testing
- Outlier analysis
- Assumption verification
- Alternative estimators
- Sensitivity analysis

### Tool Proficiency
- R/RStudio workflows
