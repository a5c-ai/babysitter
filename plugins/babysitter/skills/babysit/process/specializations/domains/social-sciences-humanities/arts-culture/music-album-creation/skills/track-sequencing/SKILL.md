# Track Sequencing

Design optimal track order and album flow for cohesive listening experiences.

## Overview

This skill provides frameworks for sequencing tracks to create compelling album journeys. It covers opener/closer strategy, energy curve design, transition planning, pacing psychology, and format considerations.

## Capabilities

### Opener Strategy
- Create immediate impact
- Set album tone and expectations
- Hook listener attention
- Establish sonic palette
- Introduce key themes

### Closer Strategy
- Provide satisfying resolution
- Create lasting impression
- Resolve thematic elements
- Leave emotional resonance
- Consider reprise/callback

### Energy Curve Design
- Map intensity across album
- Create peaks and valleys
- Build to climaxes
- Design recovery moments
- Balance tension and release

### Transition Planning
- Create flow between tracks
- Consider key relationships
- Match/contrast tempos
- Design sonic bridges
- Plan crossfades

### Pacing Psychology
- Understand listener fatigue
- Place breathers strategically
- Maintain engagement
- Create surprise moments
- Reward patience

### Format Considerations
- Plan vinyl side breaks
- Consider streaming behavior
- Account for skip patterns
- Design single placement
- Create playlist-friendly excerpts

## Sequencing Frameworks

### The Classic Album Arc
```
Track 1: HOOK - Immediate impact opener
Track 2: MOMENTUM - Build on opener energy
Track 3: PEAK 1 - First major highlight/single
Track 4: EXPLORE - New territory, develop themes
Track 5: BREATHER - Lower energy, intimate moment
Track 6: REBUILD - Regain momentum
Track 7: PEAK 2 - Second highlight, emotional core
Track 8: DESCENT - Begin resolution
Track 9: ASCENT - Final build
Track 10: RESOLUTION - Closer, lasting impression
```

### Energy Intensity Patterns
| Pattern | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Mountain | Low-High-Low | Classic narrative arc |
| Double Peak | High-Low-High-Low-High | Epic albums |
| Plateau | Consistent intensity | Dance/party albums |
| Cascade | High to low descent | Emotional journey |
| Climb | Low to high ascent | Building experience |

### Track Role Types
| Role | Position | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| Opener | Track 1 | Set tone, grab attention |
| Statement | Tracks 2-4 | Establish album identity |
| Single | Tracks 2-4 | Commercial highlight |
| Experimental | Mid-album | Push boundaries |
| Breather | Mid-album | Provide rest |
| Deep Cut | Mid-late | Reward devoted listeners |
| Heart | Variable | Emotional core |
| Closer | Final | Resolution, lasting impression |
| Hidden | Post-closer | Surprise bonus |

### Transition Techniques
| Technique | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Key Match | Same key or relative minor/major |
| Key Contrast | Dramatic shift for impact |
| Tempo Match | Similar BPM for smooth flow |
| Tempo Shift | Intentional pace change |
| Sonic Bridge | Similar instruments/textures |
| Crossfade | Blend endings into beginnings |
| Gap Silence | Space for reset |
| Thematic Link | Lyrical/motif connection |

## Usage Guidelines

### Sequencing Process
1. List all tracks with key characteristics
2. Identify opener candidates (impact, tone-setting)
3. Identify closer candidates (resolution, memorable)
4. Mark energy levels for each track (1-10)
5. Identify potential singles and highlights
6. Draft energy curve
7. Sequence tracks to create flow
8. Review transitions between adjacent tracks
9. Consider format breaks (vinyl sides)
10. Test full sequence listening

## Track Sequencing

### Track Inventory
| # | Title | BPM | Key | Energy | Role | Duration |
|---|-------|-----|-----|--------|------|----------|
| - | [Title] | [BPM] | [Key] | [1-10] | [Role] | [MM:SS] |

### Energy Curve
[Visual representation or description]

### Proposed Sequence
| Position | Title | Transition Note |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| 1 (Opener) | [Title] | Sets tone with... |
| 2 | [Title] | Builds via... |
| ... | ... | ... |

### Vinyl Side Breaks (if applicable)
- Side A: Tracks 1-[X]
- Side B: Tracks [X+1]-[Y]

### Pacing Notes
- [Observations about flow]
- [Potential issues and solutions]
```

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Opener creates impact
- [ ] Energy curve is intentional
- [ ] Transitions flow naturally
- [ ] Pacing maintains interest
- [ ] Closer provides resolution
- [ ] Singles are well-placed
- [ ] Breathers prevent fatigue
