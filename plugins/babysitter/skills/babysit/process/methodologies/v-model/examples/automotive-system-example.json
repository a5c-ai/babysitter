    "projectRequirements": "Develop software for an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) - Lane Keeping Assist:\n\n1. Lane Detection\n   - Process camera feed to detect lane markings\n   - Detect left and right lane boundaries\n   - Lane detection confidence level calculation\n   - Update rate: 20 Hz (50ms)\n   - Detection range: 3-100 meters ahead\n   - Handle various road conditions (dry, wet, snow)\n\n2. Vehicle Position Calculation\n   - Calculate vehicle position within lane\n   - Measure lateral deviation from lane center\n   - Calculate heading angle relative to lane\n   - Precision: ±5cm lateral position\n\n3. Steering Intervention\n   - Calculate corrective steering torque\n   - Apply gentle steering corrections to keep vehicle centered\n   - Maximum torque: 3 Nm\n   - Smooth torque application (no sudden jerks)\n   - Driver can override at any time\n\n4. System Activation/Deactivation\n   - Activate when: speed > 60 km/h, lane markings detected, driver hands on wheel\n   - Deactivate when: speed < 55 km/h, lane markings lost, driver override detected\n   - Visual indicator of system status (off, standby, active)\n   - Audible alert on deactivation\n\n5. Safety Monitoring\n   - Camera health monitoring\n   - Sensor plausibility checks\n   - Steering actuator monitoring\n   - Watchdog monitoring of all critical functions\n   - Fail-operational mode: degrade gracefully\n\n6. Driver Monitoring\n   - Hands-on-wheel detection via steering torque sensor\n   - Alert driver if hands off wheel >15 seconds while system active\n   - Escalating warnings: visual → audible → system deactivation\n\n7. CAN Bus Communication\n   - Receive vehicle speed, steering angle, wheel speeds\n   - Send steering torque commands\n   - Send system status messages\n   - CAN message rate: 10ms for critical signals\n\n8. Diagnostic and Logging\n   - Log all system events and interventions\n   - Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) for faults\n   - Data recording for incident analysis\n   - Interface with vehicle diagnostic system (OBD-II)\n\n9. Safety Requirements (ISO 26262 ASIL B)\n   - Hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA)\n   - Functional safety requirements\n   - Safety mechanisms: plausibility checks, redundancy, monitoring\n   - Fault detection and handling\n   - Fail-safe behavior on critical faults\n\n10. Non-Functional Requirements\n    - Latency (detection to steering): <100ms\n    - Availability: >99.9% when conditions allow\n    - Operating temperature: -40°C to +85°C\n    - Vibration resistance: per ISO 16750\n    - EMC compliance: per ISO 11452\n    - MISRA C compliance\n    - AUTOSAR architecture",
