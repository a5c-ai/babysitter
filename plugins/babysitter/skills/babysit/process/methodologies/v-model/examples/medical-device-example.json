    "projectRequirements": "Develop software for an Insulin Pump Controller with the following requirements:\n\n1. Insulin Delivery\n   - Calculate and deliver basal insulin rates based on patient profile\n   - Deliver bolus insulin on demand with dose calculation\n   - Maximum single dose safety limit: 25 units\n   - Delivery accuracy: ±5% of programmed dose\n   - Delivery rate range: 0.025 to 35 units per hour\n\n2. Glucose Monitoring Integration\n   - Receive continuous glucose readings from CGM sensor\n   - Update readings every 5 minutes\n   - Alert on sensor failure or out-of-range readings\n   - Glucose range: 40-400 mg/dL\n\n3. Safety Alarms\n   - High glucose alert (configurable threshold)\n   - Low glucose alert (configurable threshold)\n   - Occlusion detection (blocked infusion line)\n   - Low reservoir alert (<20 units remaining)\n   - Battery low alert (<20% charge)\n   - All critical alarms must have audible and visual indicators\n   - Alarm history log maintained\n\n4. User Interface\n   - Display current glucose reading\n   - Show active insulin (insulin on board)\n   - Bolus calculator with carb counting\n   - Basal rate programming\n   - Settings lockout with PIN protection\n   - Large, readable display\n\n5. Data Logging\n   - Log all insulin deliveries with timestamps\n   - Log glucose readings\n   - Log alarms and user actions\n   - Data retention: minimum 90 days\n   - Export data via USB or wireless\n\n6. Safety Requirements (IEC 62304 Class C)\n   - Fail-safe operation: stop delivery on critical errors\n   - Watchdog timer monitoring\n   - Self-test on startup\n   - Redundant safety checks for dose calculations\n   - Hardware-software interface validation\n\n7. Non-Functional Requirements\n   - Response time to critical alarms: <1 second\n   - System uptime: 99.99%\n   - Battery life: minimum 7 days\n   - Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): >10,000 hours\n   - Compliance: IEC 62304, ISO 14971 (risk management), FDA 21 CFR Part 820",
