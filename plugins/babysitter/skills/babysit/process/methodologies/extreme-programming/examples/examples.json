  "teamSizeGuidelines": {
    "2-3": "Small team - Intensive pairing, everyone knows everything, very tight feedback loops",
    "4-6": "Optimal size - Good balance of collaboration and productivity, can split into 2-3 pairs",
    "7-10": "Large team - Consider splitting into sub-teams, coordinate carefully, may need dedicated coach",
    "10+": "Very large - Strongly consider splitting into multiple XP teams with clear boundaries"

  "iterationLengthGuidelines": {
    "1 week": "Short iterations - High overhead, very responsive to change, good for uncertain projects",
    "2 weeks": "Recommended - Good balance of planning overhead and flexibility, most common choice",
    "3 weeks": "Longer iterations - Lower overhead, less flexibility, good for stable requirements",
    "4+ weeks": "Not recommended - Defeats XP's fast feedback loops and adaptability"

  "velocityGuidelines": {
    "firstIteration": "Estimate conservatively. Team will establish baseline velocity.",
    "secondIteration": "Start seeing patterns. Adjust planning based on actual velocity.",
    "thirdIteration": "Velocity stabilizes. Can predict release timeline more accurately.",
    "ongoing": "Velocity should be relatively stable. Large changes indicate impediments or scope changes."

  "tips": [
    "Start with practices that provide immediate value (TDD, CI, pair programming on complex code)",
    "Don't try to adopt all 12 practices at once - build up over 2-3 iterations",
    "Trust the velocity - don't pressure team to increase estimates",
    "Keep stories small (completable in one iteration)",
    "Rotate pairs frequently to spread knowledge",
    "Fix broken builds immediately (< 10 minutes)",
    "Refactor continuously, don't let technical debt accumulate",
    "Celebrate and track team health - sustainable pace is critical",
    "Include business representatives in planning and demos",
    "Adapt practices to your context, but don't skip core practices (TDD, pairing, CI)"
