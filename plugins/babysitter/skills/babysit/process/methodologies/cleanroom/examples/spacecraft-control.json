  "systemDescription": "Attitude determination and control system (ADCS) for deep space probe mission. Controls spacecraft orientation using reaction wheels and thrusters based on star tracker and gyroscope inputs. Implements pointing algorithms for antenna communication with Earth, solar panel sun-pointing, and scientific instrument targeting. Operates autonomously for extended periods due to communication delays (up to 20 minutes). Includes fault detection, isolation, and recovery (FDIR) for sensor and actuator failures. Must maintain precise pointing (< 0.01 degrees) for antenna communication and science operations. Designed for 10+ year mission life with no maintenance possible.",
