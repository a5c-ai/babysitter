  "projectName": "Nuclear Reactor Safety Interlock System",
  "systemDescription": "Software-based safety system for nuclear reactor that monitors reactor parameters (temperature, pressure, neutron flux, coolant flow) and automatically initiates emergency shutdown (SCRAM) if safety limits are exceeded. Implements redundant monitoring with 2-out-of-3 voting logic. Provides continuous self-diagnostics and fault detection. Interfaces with physical SCRAM mechanisms (control rod insertion). Must meet NRC 10 CFR Part 50 Appendix A and IEEE 603 (safety systems in nuclear power plants). Zero tolerance for failures that could prevent reactor shutdown.",
