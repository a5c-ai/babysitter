  "projectName": "Real-Time Banking Transaction Processor",
  "systemDescription": "Core banking transaction processing system handling deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and balance inquiries. Processes transactions in real-time with ACID guarantees (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability). Manages account balances, transaction logs, and audit trails. Implements fraud detection rules and regulatory compliance checks. Interfaces with ATM network, online banking, and inter-bank settlement systems. Must maintain data integrity under all conditions including system failures, network partitions, and concurrent access. Handles millions of transactions daily with zero data corruption tolerance.",
