  "projectName": "Autopilot Flight Control System",
  "systemDescription": "Real-time flight control system for commercial aircraft autopilot. Includes altitude hold, heading control, auto-throttle, and auto-land capabilities. Must meet DO-178C Level A (catastrophic failure conditions). System interfaces with aircraft sensors (altimeter, gyroscope, GPS, airspeed) and actuators (elevators, ailerons, rudder, throttle). Required to maintain flight envelope under all normal and degraded sensor conditions.",
