  "projectName": "Scientific Calculator Library",
  "systemDescription": "Scientific calculator library providing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced functions (trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, power). Handles floating-point arithmetic with proper rounding. Includes error handling for division by zero, domain errors (sqrt of negative), and overflow/underflow. Maintains calculation history. Designed as a reusable library component for multiple applications.",
